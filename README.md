# Welcome to Evennia!

This is is an Evennia game directory being updated and maintained as 
a prototype for a couple games. The first project that I'm working on
is refactoring a game that has existed since 1997 to do modern updates
to theme, systems, web site, and more. It's bound to be a large project
and this is the working github directory for all my code.

For an overview of Evennia directory folders, see:
https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Directory-Overview#the-game-directory

I've deleted the rest of the Evennia boilerplate that used to be in this file, but 
Evennia's documentation is here:
