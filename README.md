# Welcome to Evennia!

This is is an Evennia game directory being updated and maintained as 
a prototype for a couple games. The first project that I'm working on
is refactoring a game that has existed since 1997 to do modern updates
to theme, systems, web site, and more. 

This Repo is dead since I upgraded evennia, so this is a legacy repo only.
For an updated version, see the 'mega' repo. I won't be pushing to this one
anymore.

For an overview of Evennia directory folders, see:

I've deleted the rest of the Evennia boilerplate that used to be in this file, but 
Evennia's documentation is here:
